Tic Tac Toe is a classic pen-and-paper game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking spaces in the grid, typically one player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the grid is filled without either player achieving a winning combination, the game is a draw.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play Tic Tac Toe:

Setting up the Game: Draw a 3x3 grid. This will serve as the game board.

Choosing Player Marks: Decide which player will use "X" and which will use "O". Players will alternate turns throughout the game.

Taking Turns: Players take turns placing their mark ("X" or "O") in an empty cell of the grid. The first player usually goes with "X".

Winning the Game: The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination of three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The player who achieves this wins the game.

Tie Game: If all cells in the grid are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game is a draw.
